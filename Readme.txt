Hello,
I am trying to add, commit and finally push this to my git repository.
But, It's showing some error to me:
error: dailed to push some refs to 'repository URL'
hint: updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref.
You may want to first integrate the remote changes(e.g. git pull) before
pushing again.

the error is resolved now. I first pulled and then pushed. It worked :D

doing a change once again for learning purpose
